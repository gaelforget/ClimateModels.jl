# ClimateModels.jl

This package provides a uniform interface to climate models of varying complexity and completeness. Models that range from low dimensional to whole Earth System models can be run and/or analyzed via this framework. 

It also supports e.g. cloud computing workflows that start from previous model output available over the internet. Version control, using _git_, is included to allow for workflow documentation and reproducibility.

The [JuliaCon 2021 Presentation](@ref) provides a brief (8') overview and demo of the package.

Please refer to [Examples](@ref examples) and [Manual](@ref manual)  for more detail. 

!!! note

    This package is still in early development stage. Breaking changes remain likely.
