# ClimateModels.jl

This package provides a uniform interface to climate models of varying complexity and completeness. Models that range from low dimensional to whole Earth System models can be run and/or analyzed via this framework. 

It also supports e.g. cloud computing workflows that start from previous model output available over the internet. Version control, using _git_, is included to allow for workflow documentation and reproducibility.

_Note: package in early development stage; breaking changes remain likely._
