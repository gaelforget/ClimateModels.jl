# [Examples](@id examples)

The [random walk model](RandomWalker.html) example is a good place to start. It is also presented in greater detail in the [Climate Model Interface](@ref) section to further illustrate how things work.

The examples generally fall into two categories : [Workflows That Run Models](@ref) and [Workflows That Replay Models](@ref)' output. The distinction is not strict though, as one model often depends for its input on another model's output. 

The [Trying Out The Examples](@ref) section is for users who'd like to run, modify, or experiment with the notebooks. The [User Manual](@ref manual) section on [Climate Model Interface](@ref) then outlines simple ways that models can be added to the framework. The examples presented here were built in this fashion.

In the example list below, the core language of each model is indicated and the models are sorted, more or less, by increasing dimensionality / _problem size_. The example set, collectively, demonstrates that the [Climate Model Interface](@ref) is applicable to a wide range of models, computational languages, and problem sizes.

## Trying Out The Examples

The examples are most easily run using [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl). To do it this way, one just needs to copy a `code link` provided above and paste this URL into the [Pluto.jl interface](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl/wiki/ðŸ”Ž-Basic-Commands-in-Pluto).

One can also run the notebooks (e.g., `RandomWalker.jl`) either (1) by calling `julia RandomWalker.jl` at the _shell command line_ or (2) by calling `include("RandomWalker.jl")` at the _julia REPL prompt_. 

If the shell CLI or the julia REPL is used, however, one needs to download the notebook file and potentially `Pkg.add` a few packages beforehand (`Pluto.jl` does this automatically).

#### _System Requirements_

The pure Julia examples should immediately work on any laptop or cloud computing service. 

Examples that involve Fortran, Python, or C++ should work in all linux based environments (i.e., Linux and macOS). However, those that rely on a Fortran compiler (`gfortran`) and / or on Netcdf libraries (`libnetcdf-dev`,`libnetcdff-dev`) will require that you e.g. [install gfortran](https://fortran-lang.org/learn/os_setup/install_gfortran). 

All requirements should be preinstalled in this [cloud computer](https://gesis.mybinder.org/v2/gh/JuliaClimate/GlobalOceanNotebooks/HEAD?urlpath=lab) (see the [JuliaClimate notebooks page](https://juliaclimate.github.io/GlobalOceanNotebooks/) for detail).
