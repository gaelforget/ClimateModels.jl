# [Example Guide](@id examples)

The next sections are examples which broadly fall into two categories.

## Workflows That Run Models

- one stochastic path (0D)
- a shallow water model (2D)
- the MIT general circulation model (3D, Ocean, Atmosphere, etc)

## Workflows That Access Ouputs

- access model output from cloud storage and compute temperature time series and global maps.
