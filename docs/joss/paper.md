# Summary

This package provides a uniform interface to climate models of varying complexity and completeness. Models that range from low dimensional to whole Earth System models can be run and/or analyzed via this framework. 

It also supports e.g. cloud computing workflows that start from previous model output available over the internet. Version control, using _git_, is included to allow for workflow documentation and reproducibility.

The `JuliaCon 2021 Presentation` provides a brief (8') overview and demo of the package.

# Statement of need

`ClimateModels.jl` is ... 

# Mathematics

### from template

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$

You can also use plain \LaTeX for equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
\hat f(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{i\omega x} dx
\end{equation}
and refer to \autoref{eq:fourier} from text.

# Figures

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](https://github.com/JuliaClimate/IndividualDisplacements.jl/blob/master/docs/joss/simulated_atm_flow04.png?raw=true)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
